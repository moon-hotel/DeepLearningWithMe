despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . _!_0
the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities . _!_1
the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . _!_1

despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . _!_0
mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun . _!_1
as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . _!_0
that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . _!_1
solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining . _!_1

the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . _!_0
the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . _!_0
it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . _!_0
a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . _!_0
the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . _!_0

ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . _!_0
the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . _!_0
distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . _!_0

it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . _!_0
what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . _!_1
the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but  in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has  ironically - distanced us from the characters . _!_1
nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . _!_0
accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . _!_0

it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . _!_0
a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . _!_0
the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . _!_0
writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . _!_0

the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . _!_0
the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . _!_0
it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . _!_0
no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . _!_0
the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them . _!_1
