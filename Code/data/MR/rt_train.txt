'possession , ' based on the book by a . s . byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit_!_1

a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel . _!_0
just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . _!_0

a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . _!_0
one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . _!_1
drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth . _!_1
unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . _!_0

 " red dragon " is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . _!_1

it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . _!_0
delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for . _!_1

in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . _!_0
it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties . _!_1
the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . _!_1
less than fresh . _!_0
return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . _!_0

one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time . _!_0
a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal . _!_1
it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . _!_1
ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and based on three short films and two features , here's betting her third feature will be something to behold . _!_1
there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters . _!_0

first-time writer-director serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film . _!_1
mordantly funny and intimately knowing . . . _!_1
a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . _!_1

the auteur's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug . _!_1
the story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there's a certain style and wit to the dialogue . _!_1
it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . _!_1
nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood . _!_1
the moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended . _!_1
i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending . _!_1

about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . _!_0
this is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary ! _!_1
one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . _!_1
smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off- broadway play . _!_1
the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . _!_0

takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . _!_1
there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . " the adventures of pluto nash " is a big time stinker . _!_0

feral and uncomfortable . _!_1
a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless . _!_0

meeting , even exceeding expectations , it's the best sequel since the empire strikes back . . . a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . _!_1
